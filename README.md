# Flashcards: A Spaced-Repitition Implementation

## Description

Flashcards are a crucial tool in education but can get tedious - both in writing them out and in organizing and reviewing them. This web app is a flashcard program that addresses these two problems electronically by allowing:

- digital entry, edit and storage
- self-scoring and thus adaptive presentation of cards

In addition to being a project of personal interest, this web app fulfills the first project requirement for the [General Assembly Software Immersive Engineer Remote course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive-remote).
